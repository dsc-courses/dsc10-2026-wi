## 🧐 About

Welcome to DSC 10 at UC San Diego! This course aims to teach you how to draw
conclusions about data. We will learn how to explore data and make predictions
using data. Programming is a useful tool to help us analyze large datasets,
and so we will learn how to program in Python towards this goal. We will learn
some of the core techniques of data science, and we will practice applying them
to real datasets from a variety of different disciplines.  

Prerequisites: None. This course is an introduction to data science with no
prior background assumed beyond high school algebra. Make sure you are well-prepared by taking [this pretest](https://practice.dsc10.com/pretest/).

If you are not planning on
entering the DSC major/minor and have already taken a programming class and a
statistics class, you may wish to take a more advanced course. If you are a DSC
major/minor, DSC 10 is absolutely required, as later courses heavily reference
its specific content.

### Acknowledgements

The contents of this course come from UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, created by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and many others. This offering builds off of earlier offerings of DSC 10 by Justin Eldridge, Suraj Rampure, Janine Tiefenbruck, and many others. Thanks to all those who have a played a role in shaping this amazing course!

## 👨‍🏫 Course Meetings

### Lecture

There are four lecture sections:
- Section A: MWF 9-9:50AM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Section B: MWF 10-10:50AM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Section C: MWF 11-11:50AM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Section D: MWF 9-9:50AM in [PODEM 1A19](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/761769).

Lecture is meant to introduce you to the main concepts of the course. In-person attendance is never required, but is strongly encouraged when possible, as you’ll get the opportunity to ask questions, answer ungraded concept-check polls, and participate in discussion. 

You can attend any lecture section, but if space fills up, priority will be given to students officially enrolled in that section. For the Midterm Exam, you must attend the lecture section in which you are officially enrolled.

**Lectures will be podcasted** (UCSD's term for "recorded"). Podcast recordings will be available online at [podcast.ucsd.edu](https://podcast.ucsd.edu) within a few hours. 


### Pods

Outside of lecture, this class has two additional hours designated for this class in the schedule of classes. One of these hours, on Monday afternoon, appears as DI in the schedule of classes, and will be used for discussion sections. The other hour, on Wednesday afternoon, appears as LA in the schedule of classes, and will be used for both quizzes and small group (pod) meetings. 

Pods will be groups of 20 to 30 students, mentored by a couse tutor. Pods will consist of students who will all attend the same lecture, discussion, quiz times, and pod meetings. Pods are meant to give you the experience of being in a "microclass" within a much larger course. 

To help us assign you to a pod that works for your schedule, please let us know your availability and preferences on the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog). You will be assigned to a pod based on your preferences and the availability of seats.  We will confirm your assigned pod and meeting times by email before Monday of Week 1.


### Discussion 

There are four discussion sections:
- Mondays 1-1:50PM in [FAH 1450](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/610083).
- Mondays 3-3:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Mondays 4-4:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Mondays 5-5:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).

You will be assigned to a specific discussion section based on your availability and preferences as indicated on the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog). You must attend your assigned discussion section to get credit for attendance.

The first discussion includes some useful instruction and tips for using Jupyter notebooks and Datahub, the programming tools we'll be using in this course. It should be helpful to get you set up and comfortable with the technology you'll be using all quarter. 

Subsequent discussion sections will be focused on quiz and exam preparation. Students will work through problems from past DSC 10 quizzes and exams and be able to get help from course staff. Attending discussion and working through practice problems gives you direct experience with the types of questions you will see on quizzes and exams, which are typically the hardest parts of the course.

**Discussion sections will not be podcasted.** The purpose of discussion is to give you hands-on problem-solving experience, so you really need to attend and participate to reap the benefits. 

<!-- {: .warning }
**In the Schedule of Classes, this course is listed as having both a discussion section (DI) and a lab section (LA), but we will only have one weekly meeting outside of lecture, which we’ll refer to as a discussion section, scheduled at the time listed above. You should ignore what you see as DI or LA on WebReg and just use the schedule above instead.** -->

### Quizzes and Pod Meetings

On five Wednesdays throughout the quarter, we will have short 20-minute quizzes. On four other Wednesdays throughout the quarter, you will meet with your pod and mentor. Pod meetings will be purely social and are designed to help you make connections with classmates and your mentor, not to work on any specific course-related material. 

Quizzes and pod meetings will be held on Wednesday afternoons at one of the following times.
- Wednesdays 2-2:50PM in [FAH 1101](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/610083).
- Wednesdays 3-3:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Wednesdays 4-4:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).
- Wednesdays 5-5:50PM in [PCYNH 106](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/246320).

You will be assigned to a specific time for quizzes and pod meetings based on your availability and preferences as indicated on the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog). You must attend at your assigned time to get credit for attendance.

### Office Hours

In order to provide you with help on assignments and concepts, the course staff
will hold several office hours throughout the week, all of which will be held in-person. See the
[Calendar](../calendar) tab of the course website for the most up-to-date schedule and instructions.

{: .note }
**We use the term "office hours" but really, office hours are held in a common room where you can come to work on assignments, meet your classmates, and get help from course staff. We don't bite and we would love to see you in office hours!**

Office hours are your chance to ask for general help, clarification on
assignments, and to review previous assignments. Our tutors have previously
taken the class, done well, and been trained in how to help you. Course staff
will not tell you if your answer is correct, and it is not appropriate to ask.
Here are some really good questions to ask instead:

- I got confused about a concept in class. Can you explain it?
- When the assignment says X, does it mean A or B?
- My code is giving a weird error - can you help me understand why?
- I can’t get this test to pass, so I must be doing something wrong. Can you
  help me figure it out?
- My code is doing something different than what I expected. Can you explain
  what is happening?

Questions that you should never ask a tutor:

- Is this the right answer?
- Can you check my code and make sure it is right?
- What is the answer?
- What’s going to be on the exam?

Your primary motivation when interacting with course staff should be
**learning**.

## 🚦 Getting Started

Make sure to complete the four items listed below by **Saturday, September 27th at 11:59PM**. If you join the course late, these items are due at 11:59PM the day after you join the class.

1. Join [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GF283E889) (join code: 8258).
2. Check if you can access [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1141203). If not, send a private message to the instructional staff on Campuswire with your name, PID, and email address, then we can add you so you can submit assignments.
3. Read the syllabus and course website and complete the [Syllabus Check](https://forms.gle/A2Q3Qrg72QQpRveP8).
4. Fill out the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog).

After that, start working on the [Pretest](https://practice.dsc10.com/pretest/). You will need to submit your written solutions to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1009023) alongside your first assignment, Lab 0.


### Technology

First and foremost, you will need access to a computer (or tablet with a
keyboard) and a stable internet connection to participate in this course. UCSD
has a [Laptop Lending Program](https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/financial-security/laptop-lending-program.html) which may be helpful, but you should also contact
us if you have any concerns about access to technology. Most students bring a computer to lecture, and a computer or tablet will be necessary for discussion sections.
All course content will be linked from this website, but there are a few
additional platforms that you'll need to access:

- **Campuswire:** We'll be using Campuswire as our course message and
  discussion board. More details are in the [Communication](#-communication)
  section below. If you didn't already get an invitation, [join here](https://campuswire.com/c/GF283E889) (join code: 8258).

- **Gradescope:** You'll submit all assignments and exams to
  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1141203). This is where all of
  your grades will live as well. You will be automatically added to Gradescope about 24 hours after enrolling in the course. If you need to submit assignments before then, please send a private message to the instructional staff on Campuswire with your name, PID, and email address.

- **DataHub:** Assignments in this course will involve programming in Python.
  DataHub ([datahub.ucsd.edu](https://datahub.ucsd.edu)) is UCSD's online data
  science and machine learning platform, where you will work on assignments. We
  will show you how to use it in class.

Make sure you can access all three sites. It's a good idea to bookmark
them, too (though they're all linked at the top of this website).

{: .warning }
**We will not be using Canvas this quarter. Please do not contact the staff through Canvas – we won't be able to read it!**

### Syllabus Check

To demonstrate that you have read and understood the policies on the syllabus and course website, you'll be asked to complete a [Syllabus Check](https://forms.gle/A2Q3Qrg72QQpRveP8), which is a short quiz about the information contained on the syllabus and course website. 

You must complete the Syllabus Check before the deadline with a score of **80% or higher to earn credit**. You can only take this quiz once, so make sure to read the course website thoroughly before beginning.

If you have questions about any course-related policies in the future, always refer to the syllabus and course website first!

### Welcome Survey

Please fill out this short [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog) at the start of the quarter. This is required of all students.

### Pretest

DSC 10’s only prerequisite is high school algebra. In order to gauge your preparedness for the type of math you’ll see in this class, you should work through the practice problems on this [Pretest](https://practice.dsc10.com/pretest/). This Pretest will help you identify any gaps in your background knowledge and it will teach you some useful test-taking skills. 

The Pretest will be graded based on honest effort, not on the correctness of your responses. You will earn some participation credit for working on the Pretest and submitting your written solutions to Gradescope by the deadline.

We'll release solutions to the Pretest after the due date, and you are highly encouraged to check how you did and learn from it.

---

## 💬 Communication

This quarter, we’ll be using [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GF283E889) (join code: 8258) as our course message board.

If you have a question about anything to do with the course — if you’re stuck
on a problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general
question about data science — you can make a post on Campuswire. If your post
includes any part of your solution to a problem (e.g. code), please make your
post private; otherwise, please make your post public so that other students
can benefit from the interaction. You can also post anonymously if you prefer.
Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions
that you have. You’re also encouraged to answer a question asked by another
student if you feel that you know the answer – this is a great way to
strengthen your understanding of the material.

{: .note }
Please use Campuswire **instead of email**, as this helps us keep all course-related
communication in one place. In particular, don't send course staff questions about course content through email, Canvas, or social media – Campuswire is the place for that.

---

## 📕 Readings

Our readings will come from two free online sources.

- [Computational and Inferential Thinking
  ("CIT")](https://inferentialthinking.com) is the main textbook for the course, written to support UC Berkeley's version of this course, from which DSC 10 was adapted. This book uses some different Python commands (it does not use the `babypandas` module), but the underlying concepts are the same.
- [Notes on (Baby)Pandas ("BPD")](https://notes.dsc10.com) are a set of notes
  about the `babypandas` module, written specifically for DSC 10 students.

---

## 🧪 Assignments

### Lab Assignments

Weekly lab assignments are a required part of the course and will help you
develop fluency in Python and working with data. The labs are designed to help
you build the skills you need to complete homework assignments and projects in
a low-stress setting.

As you complete the lab, you'll be able to run a sequence of autograder tests,
which check to make sure that your answers are correct. If you complete the
assignment such that all the tests pass, you'll get a perfect score!

To submit a lab, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your
notebook to Gradescope, which will run automated tests and assign your score.
You should verify that all of your test cases pass on Gradescope **before the
deadline**. Lab assignments will usually be due on Thursdays at 11:59PM, 
though you should refer to the [homepage of this website](..) for the most up-to-date schedule. We will
release lab assignments roughly a week before they're due. **Your lowest lab score
is dropped from your grade calculation at the end of the quarter.**

Labs must be completed and submitted individually, but we encourage you to
discuss high-level approaches with others. See the [Academic Integrity Policies](#-academic-integrity-policies) section
for more details.

### Homework Assignments

Weekly homework assignments build off of the skills you have developed in labs.
Homeworks will reinforce concepts from class, explore new ideas, and provide
hands-on experience working with data.

An important difference between labs and homeworks lies in the way autograder
tests are run. Unlike the tests in the labs, the tests in the homework cannot
be used to guarantee that you have the correct answers. The tests in the
homework only check to make sure that your answer is appropriately formatted, not that it is
correct. For example, if a homework question asks you to calculate a percentage,
the test in the homework might only check that the answer you provide is a number
between 0 and 100. **You should make sure that all the tests pass before
submitting your homework, but this will not guarantee a perfect score.**

After you submit your homework to Gradescope, and after the deadline for
submissions has passed, a new set of hidden tests will be run to make sure that
you have the correct answers. In the percentage example above, the hidden test
might check that your answer equals 56, for example. Your score for the
assignment will be based on the results of the hidden tests, which won't be
available immediately after submission. So if you see a perfect score upon
submission, this only means that you've passed the formatting tests, not the
hidden correctness tests that determine your score.

To submit a homework, follow the instructions in the assignment to upload your
notebook to Gradescope. Homeworks will usually be due on Saturdays at
11:59PM, though you should refer to the [homepage of this website](..) for the most up-to-date schedule. 
We will release homework assignments roughly a week before they're
due. **Your lowest homework score
is dropped from your grade calculation at the end of the quarter.**

Like labs, homeworks must be completed and submitted individually, but we
encourage you to discuss high-level approaches with others. See the
[Academic Integrity Policies](#-academic-integrity-policies) section for more
details.

### Projects

This class has two projects, a Midterm Project and a Final Project. Projects
are like more challenging homeworks. They are longer than a typical homework,
and they require you to pull together ideas from previous weeks, rather than
just the last week. Projects also give you a chance to explore a dataset
in-depth, which can be a lot of fun!

Project tests are like homework tests – the provided tests only check if your
answers have the correct format, not if they are correct. You'll only be able to see
your score on the project after the deadline, once all projects are submitted
and the hidden correctness tests have been run.

**Unlike labs and homeworks, you may work with a partner on projects.** Your
partner can be anyone else in any section of the course. If you choose to
work with a partner, start by reading these [project partner guidelines](../project-partners).
If working with a partner, only one of you should submit the assignment, and you'll be able to tag your partner in your Gradescope submission.

### Deadlines and Slip Days

Labs, homeworks, and projects must be submitted by 11:59PM on the due date to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before
the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it's a
good habit to **submit early and often**.

{: .warning }
When submitting any assignment to Gradescope, make sure to stick around until you 
see a confirmation that all tests have passed. If the Gradescope autograder 
cannot grade your work or you see a message saying "Your submission timed out," 
this indicates an error with your code, and it is your responsibility to identify 
and solve the problem before the deadline.

It may take some time for Gradescope's autograder to grade your submission. 
You are encouraged to submit with enough time to see the output of the autograder before the 11:59PM deadline, 
as it may alert you to a problem you need to fix. However, if you submit before 
11:59PM and the autograder finishes running after 11:59PM, your assigment will still be 
considered on time. 

After submitting, check that you got a confirmation email 
from Gradescope to verify that your submission was successful. Save this email 
until you receive your grade on the assignment, in case of any issues with your submission.

You are allotted **six "slip days"** to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends
the deadline of any one homework, lab, or project by 24 hours. You cannot turn
in any assignments more than 48 hours late, meaning that you cannot use more
than 2 slip days on any assignment.

Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency
in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an
assignment on its original due date. But slip days are also meant for things
like the internet (or the DataHub server) going down at 11:58PM just as you go
to submit your homework. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so you probably should not need to use all six, but if you have
something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your
classwork on time, please reach out to us **before** using up all your slip days.

**Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don't
need to ask in order to use one.** It's your responsibility to keep track of
how many you have left. If you've run out of slip days and submit an assignment
late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when
we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you
use all six slip days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip
days first to the Final Project and Midterm Project, then to your homeworks (in
chronological order), and then to your labs (in chronological order). This is
done to prevent you from receiving a 0 on, say, the Final Project, if you've
used up all of your slip days at the end of the quarter; in such an example,
you'd instead receive a 0 on an earlier assignment that isn't weighted as much
in your grade.

If you submit the Midterm Project or Final Project late and are working with a partner, 
both you and your partner will have to use slip days. For example, if you submit the Midterm Project two days late, both you and your partner will lose two slip days.

### Submission Errors

It is your responsibility to ensure that your work is submitted correctly to
Gradescope as a `.ipynb` file, and that the Gradescope autograder can grade your work.  Watch 20:05 and onwards of [this
video](https://youtu.be/Hq8VaNirDRQ?t=1206) to see two ways of downloading
Jupyter notebooks as a `.ipynb` file.

When submitting your work, there are two common errors to watch out for:

1. Submitting your notebook in the wrong format, e.g. submitting as a `.json`
   or `.txt` file instead of a `.ipynb` file. If you do this, the Gradescope
   autograder will not be able to grade your work, and you will get a 0. This
   can almost certainly be avoided by watching the aforementioned video, and by 
   waiting until you see confirmation from Gradescope that all tests have passed. 
2. Submitting the wrong notebook, e.g. submitting your Lab 6 notebook to the
   Homework 6 assignment on Gradescope. This will also give you a 0, because
   the Gradescope autograder for a particular assignment can only grade your
   work for that assignment. To avoid this error, make sure to stick around on 
   Gradescope after submission until you see that all tests have passed.

{: .warning }
To prevent these issues, it is important that you let the autograder run on Gradescope until it shows you under “Public Tests” that all public test cases passed. Do not navigate away from Gradescope until you see this confirmation that your submission was able to be successfully graded!

If you happen to make one of the above mistakes and you notice it yourself 
within 48 hours of the deadline, please resubmit your assignment. Since we always grade your latest submission, a resubmission after the deadline will use up slip days. If it is more than 48 hours since the deadline,
please reach out to a staff member and we may allow you to resubmit it late, at the cost of 2 slip days.
It is your responsibility to ensure that all assignments are submitted correctly.

## 📝 Assessments

We will assess your knowledge of course material frequently through quizzes and exams. Quizzes and exams will be administered on paper, without the use of computers or calculators. You'll have access to a large collection of [practice problems](https://practice.dsc10.com/) to help you prepare. You'll see some of these problems in discussion sections and during in-class exam reviews, but the more you practice, the better prepared you'll be for the assessments.

Exams and quizzes are designed to test your understanding of course material, therefore you must use methods of the course to earn credit. Solutions that are correct but outside of the scope of the course will not earn credit.

### Exams

This class has one Midterm Exam and one Final Exam:
- Midterm Exam: Wednesday, October 29th, **during your enrolled lecture slot**.
- Final Exam: Saturday, December 6th from 3 to 6PM, location TBD.

Exams are cumulative, though the Final Exam will emphasize material after the Midterm Exam. Both exams will be held **in-person and on-paper**. You'll be allowed to use one 8.5 by 11 inch page of double-sided handwritten notes, but no calculators, computers, or other resources.

If you have a conflict with either exam, you should let us know right away via the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLvqLbgbPuOj6bb40k0e8JRs0epBA-BMA8I0HasTMjiz8elQ/viewform?usp=dialog) to see if accomodations can be made. Without express permission otherwise, students are required to take both exams at the scheduled times.

### Quizzes

Quizzes are designed to help you get more practice solving problems on-paper without a computer in front of you, as you'll need to do on exams. Like exams, quizzes are in-person and on-paper. You'll be allowed to use one 8.5 by 11 inch page of double-sided handwritten notes, but no calculators, computers, or other resources. Quiz questions are meant to be more straightforward than exam questions, but they will help you build the skills you need to perform well on exams, as well as help you identify any areas you need more practice in before the exam. 

There are five quizzes throughout the quarter, administered during your assigned quiz time on the following dates:

- Quiz 1: Wednesday, October 15th
- Quiz 2: Wednesday, October 22nd
- Quiz 3: Wednesday, November 12th
- Quiz 4: Wednesday, November 19th
- Quiz 5: Wednesday, December 3rd

We will count only your three highest quiz scores towards your grade. In other words, we will drop your two lowest quiz scores.

Quizzes are designed to give you low-stakes opportunities to practice solving problems on paper, with room for failure. You don't need to do well on every quiz to do well in the course.

{: .warning }
We will not offer makeup quizzes. If you are sick, traveling, or otherwise need to miss a quiz, you have some flexibility because not all scores will be factored into your grade.

You must attend quizzes at **your assigned time**; see the [Quizzes and Pod Meetings](#quizzes-and-pod-meetings) section of the syllabus for details.

A portion of your grade will be allocated towards participation.

There will be 17 participation points available:

- 1 point for the Pretest, graded for honest effort.
- 1 point for passing the Syllabus Check at 80% or higher.
- 1 point for completing SETs (Student Evaluations of Teaching) and an internal End-Of-Quarter Survey. 
- 1 point for attending each discussion section (10 points total).
- 1 point for attending each pod meeting (4 points total).

**Score 12 points or higher for full participation credit.** If you earn fewer than 12 points, your participation grade will be the number of points earned out of 12. There is no extra credit for earning more than 12 points.

---

## 💯 Grades

The table below shows how your mastery of class material will be assessed and
how grades will be computed:

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Notes** |
| Participation | 10% | |
| Lab Assignments | 10% | drop lowest score |
| Homework Assignments | 20% | drop lowest score |
| Quizzes | 10% | drop two lowest scores |
| Midterm Project | 10% | |
| Midterm Exam | 10% | |
| Final Project | 10% | |
| Final Exam | 20% | |

Note that in each category, all assignments in that category will be worth the same amount,
regardless of the number of points they are graded out of.

### Regrade Requests

If you'd like to request a regrade on any assignment, you must do so within one
week of the assignment being graded. If you think there is a problem with the
autograder,  please fill out the [Autograder Regrade Request Form](https://forms.gle/qTKubrnLCjBHSfzU6). 
If you think there is a problem with how a manually-graded question was graded, submit a regrade request through Gradescope.

### Letter Grades and Incompletes

We will use a standard scale for assigning letter grades:

| **Letter Grade** | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D | F |
| **Percentage** | 93+ | 90+ | 87+ | 83+ | 80+ | 77+ | 73+ | 70+ | 60+ | below 60 |

A+ grades are given at the instructor's discretion. If you are taking the
course P/NP, you will receive a grade of P if you meet the criteria for a C-
grade, otherwise you will receive a grade of NP.

Grades may be curved depending on overall averages. In recent quarters, there has been a small curve.

## 🤝 Academic Integrity Policies

The basic rule for DSC 10 is: Work hard. Make use of the expertise of the staff
to learn what you need to know to really do well in the course. Act with
integrity, and don't cheat.

If you do cheat, we will enforce the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship](https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2).
This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will
put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that
by taking this course, their assignments will be submitted to third party
software to help detect plagiarism.

### Why is academic integrity important?

Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus.
When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for
someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their
academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades
(and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This
devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for
the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are
honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be
proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD!

The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the
standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your
good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot
list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic
integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations.

### What counts as cheating?

In DSC 10, you can read books, surf the web, talk to your friends and the DSC
10 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete
your assignments. However, no other person should complete your work for you or write
any of the code you submit in this course, with the exception of the work you do with a project partner.

The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed in DSC 10
(not an exhaustive list):

- Using or submitting code acquired from other individuals.
- Posting your code online, including on Campuswire, unless privately to
  instructors only.
- Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf.
- Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.
- Providing code, exam questions, or solutions to any other student in the
  course.
- Splitting up project questions with your project partner and each
  working on different questions.
- Collaborating with others on quizzes or exams.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are
allowed in DSC 10 (not an exhaustive list):

- Discussing the general approach to solving homework problems or projects.
- Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you
  solved them.
- Discussing the answers to quizzes or exams once all students in all sections of the course have taken the assessment.
- Using code provided in class or in any assigned readings or videos.
- Google searching for documentation on Python or babypandas.
- Working together with other students on assignments without copying or
  sharing answers.
- Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Campuswire, without
  sharing your code.

The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgment and remembering
to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage.
Here are some suggestions for completing your work:

- Don't look at or discuss the details of another student's code for an
  assignment you are working on, and don't let another student look at your
  code.
- Don't start with someone else's code and make changes to it, or in any way
  share code with other students.
- If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don't take notes,
  and wait an hour afterward before you write any code.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) describes tools, such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and GitHub Copilot, that are trained to generate responses to user-defined prompts, or questions. The existence of such tools is a major milestone in machine learning, and an impressive application of data science in the real world. 

Our course policy on the use of GenAI tools for coursework is simple: you may use these tools to build an understanding of course material and to assist you on assignments, keeping in mind that no tool is a substitute for a strong understanding of course concepts. 

Be mindful of how you are using GenAI tools. These tools can be very useful to help you preview material before lecture, summarize material after lecture, explain concepts you didn’t understand, and explore how different concepts are related. “Explain it like I’m five” can be a helpful prompt to give you a basic understanding of new concepts before being exposed to them in lecture. Consolidating your knowledge after learning something new and relating it to other things you know is important for learning and retention. Unfortunately, GenAI tools are not a consistently reliable source of quality information.

For example, we asked ChatGPT to tell us about the Central Limit Theorem, an idea we will learn about towards the end of the quarter. The answer we get back is actually quite <b><span style="color:green">good</span></b>.

<center>

<img src="../assets/images/chatgpt-clt.png" width="75%">
<br>
Good answer, ChatGPT!

</center>

However, we also asked ChatGPT to tell us about permutation testing, another idea from the second half of the quarter. The answer we got back was <b><span style="color:red">wrong</span></b> in very subtle ways, though it might sound correct to someone learning about permutation testing for the first time. Thinking about why ChatGPT’s answer is wrong is a useful learning exercise.

<center>

<img src="../assets/images/chatgpt-perm.png" width="75%">
<br>
Not quite...

</center>

As this example illustrates, be skeptical about anything you learn from GenAI tools. Because of how GenAI tools are trained, they are designed to provide answers that _sound_ correct, not necessarily ones that _are_ correct. A goal of your education is to develop an ability to identify and produce information that actually is correct and doesn’t just sound correct. Human supervision of GenAI tools is always necessary. 

In addition, proceed with caution when using tools to assist you with your assignments. DSC 10 is a foundational class for your study of data science; you need to master the skills and concepts of this course if you want to use data science effectively. Through quizzes and exams, you will be tested on your independent ability to apply course material to novel problems. Homeworks, labs, and projects are meant to prepare you for these assessments, so overreliance on GenAI for assignments will rob you of opportunities to learn and make it hard for you to perform well on assessments.

If you do use GenAI to assist you on assignments, keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Design your prompts carefully.** Don’t just ask one question; ask a follow-up question based on the output to the first. To use these tools effectively, you need to engineer your prompts carefully. 
- **Test the outputs.** GenAI tools can and do make mistakes, and being able to verify the correctness of a proposed answer is an important skill for you to develop. Validate the output against course-provided references, or follow up with a search on Google or Stack Overflow.   Remember that GenAI tools provide crowdsourced likely answers, not necessarily correct answers.
- **Don’t submit any code that you don’t understand, or that uses content not taught in this class.** In this introductory course, we expose you to a limited set of Python tools that you can use to solve a wide range of problems. When you prompt a GenAI tool with a question from DSC 10, it will not be limited to our restricted toolkit, and may provide answers using much more complicated code.  If you answer questions with out-of-scope content, you are not practicing the foundational skills that the course is meant to teach you. In addition, your code may not pass correctness tests that require your solution to use methods taught in the course.


If your assignment submission includes any content generated by an AI tool, it should be cited to acknowledge the source of the material. At the end of each assignment, you will be provided with a space to explain and reflect on your use of GenAI tool(s).

## ❓ Waitlist FAQs

**I am on the waitlist, but I really want to get into the course. Can you let me in?**

Sorry, but instructors are not able to enroll students in classes. There is nothing we can do let you into the course.

**I am on the waitlist, so how can I keep up with the course?**

Waitlisted to students may attend lecture and discussion, space-permitting, and can also watch podcast recordings. You can (and should) still submit assignments if you are on the waitlist. If you get off the waitlist and are able to join the class, you will not get any extensions on past-due assignments. 

Waitlisted students should have access to DataHub to work on assignments. You may need to add yourself to some course tools; see the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) section of the syllabus. If you need access to Gradescope, send a private message to the instructional staff on Campuswire with your name, PID, and email address.

**What are my chances of getting off the waitlist?**

The instructional staff is not equipped to answer this question. Many questions
about enrollment are [answered
here](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/current-students/enrolling-in-classes/). Please direct
your questions about enrollment to DSC advising. You can send an email to
[dscstudent@ucsd.edu](mailto:dscstudent@ucsd.edu), send a message through the
Virtual Advising Center, or stop by drop-in advising hours. In short, seats in
the class open up when students drop the class, which can be hard to predict.

**I have been added to Gradescope, Campuswire, and other course tools. Does
this mean I am off the waitlist?**

No. Students on the waitlist were added to all course tools, so they can
complete assignments while they are on the waitlist. Check
[WebReg](https://act.ucsd.edu/webreg2) if you are not sure of your enrollment
status.
