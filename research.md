## Research Projects

Instructors for DSC 10 are conducting research studies to better understand how
students learn programming and data science — and how AI tools might be helpful
(or not!) in that learning process.

Your participation is **completely optional**. You may **opt out at any time**,
and **opting out will not affect your grade in this course in any way**. By
participating in our research, you can help contribute to our understanding of
how to best support students learning programming and data science.

### What participation might involve

Depending on the study, participation may include one or more of the following:

- Allowing researchers to analyze de-identified course artifacts (e.g.,
  assignment submissions, code snapshots, or interaction logs).
- Completing short surveys about your learning experience.
- Participating in an optional interview or focus group.

Specific details will always be provided before you decide to participate.

### Voluntary participation and opting out

- Participation is opt-in and not required for the course.
- You can decline to participate or withdraw at any point.
- Choosing not to participate (or withdrawing) will not change your access
  to course resources or support, and will not impact your grade.

### Privacy

When course-related data are used for research, we aim to protect your privacy
by:

- Using de-identified data whenever possible.
- Reporting results in aggregate, so individual students are not identified.

### How to opt out
